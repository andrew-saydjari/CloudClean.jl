Image infilling algorithm with focus on statistically accuracy

## Installation
<!-- 
**CloudClean** is a registered package so a stable version can be installed using `Pkg.add`.

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("CloudClean")
```
-->
For the most recent development version, install directly from the GitHub

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/andrew-saydjari/CloudClean.jl")
```

## Description

By leveraging the local pixel-pixel covarariance structure in an image, CloudClean attempts to predict the values of missing pixels based on near-by unmasked pixels. The user needs only to provide an image and a mask of "bad" pixels and the choice of a few hyper parameters. CloudClean has two main operating modes:

1. proc_discrete, which attempts to fill in masked data in a subregion centered on a discrete list of input points
2. proc_continuous, which infills arbitrarily shaped and centered masks. The latter is like "Photoshop" for images with correlated structure.

This code is based heavily upon (and is in some sense a simplification of) [CloudCovErr.jl](https://github.com/andrew-saydjari/CloudCovErr.jl).

## Example

An example of the quality of the prediction for missing pixels is demonstrated on this image from the WISE 12 Î¼m dust map. More examples, notebooks, and documentation are in process.
